### Hi, I'm Ari! 👋🏽

I'm a second-year student at [Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu),
majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics!

Currently, I'm more focused on "higher-order" programming: metaprogramming, and
writing programs that do work with programs. Things like interpreters, compilers,
and macro systems. To this end, I have experience in langauges like Rust, Ocaml, and
Racket. I also have experience with web development technologies like JavaScript,
TypeScript (using frameworks like React and Next.js), and "native" apps using Electron. 

I also occasionally play around with the Minecraft protocol and make somewhat useful
things with it (at least useful to me).

I'm most interested in learning about the theory behind programming languages, and
how we can use the tools of mathematics and logic to think about programs and computation.
In this area, I have experience with proof assistants and I'm currently auditing a course
focused on type systems, their features, and their safety guarantees.

I'm also involved with the Labs team for [TransitMatters](https://transitmatters.org), a
Boston-based group that advocates for improvements to local and regional transit, and
have done some work on the [TransitMatters dashboard](https://dashboard.transitmatters.org).

Check out [my website](https://ariscript.org/)!

Feel free to contact me via the socials linked there, or email if necessary.
